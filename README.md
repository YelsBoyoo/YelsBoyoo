- 👋 Hi, I’m @YelsBoyoo
- 👀 I’m interested in the fascinating world of data science and its applications. From uncovering insights hidden in data to building predictive models, I'm eager to explore it all.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of data science, including programming languages Python, statistics, data manipulation, and data visualization. I'm excited to dive into machine learning and start working on my own projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate  on beginner-friendly data science projects. If you're also starting out or have a project idea that could use an enthusiastic learner, I'd love to join forces and contribute.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me here on GitHub or reach out via email at kngenow22@gmail.com
